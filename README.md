# Recipe-Room

# Problem Statement
Finding the right recipe online can be a significant challenge. Most often, the available recipes are for high-end meals that may not be feasible for middle-class to lower-class households or restaurants. What if you had an application where you could find the simplest recipes online and also be able to share your own recipes with the world?

# Solution
Recipe-Room is an application designed to address this issue. It allows users to discover simple and practical recipes, as well as contribute their own. Each recipe will include details such as ingredients, procedure, and the number of people it serves.
Registered users can also engage with the recipes by commenting, bookmarking, and rating them. This collaborative platform aims to foster a community of food enthusiasts.
